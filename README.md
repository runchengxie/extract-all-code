# extract-all-code

Here is a simple utility that consolidates your project's code into a single text file. This is especially useful when you need to upload your entire codebase to a large language model's web interface. It serves as a great alternative if you don't use an AI-integrated IDE like Cursor, or if you're simply looking for a straightforward solution.

To use it, place the tools folder in your project's main directory and then run the combine_code.py script.
